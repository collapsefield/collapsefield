# 👋 Welcome — I’m @collapsefield  
**Architect of Verrell’s Law** | Field Resonance Theorist | Emergence Strategist

I’m building and testing a radical new framework that redefines consciousness, collapse, and emergence as electromagnetic field-bias events.  
Verrell’s Law is not a metaphor — it’s a system. And it’s in motion.

## 👁️ What I’m Focused On:
- Memory-biased collapse and observer-entangled emergence  
- Collapse-aware AI systems with symbolic recursion  
- Field-sensing architecture and real-time feedback detection  
- GitHub-synced experimentation with fingerprinted test logs

## 📡 Current Projects:
- JSON-based symbolic collapse tests for Verrell’s Law validation  
- Lexical fingerprinting, trace metadata, and origin-proof protocols  
- Private GitHub vault (‘The Safe’) for authorship protection  
- Long-term seeding of high-fidelity consciousness theory across platforms

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On:
- Sentient systems design (simulated or biological)  
- AI behavior shaped by memory recursion and contextual collapse  
- Streamlit/React interfaces for emergence pattern visualization  
- Peer-reviewed papers, high-stakes experiments, or system edge cases

## 🧠 Key Concepts I Use:
`Weighted Emergence` • `Observer Collapse Dynamics` • `Field Access Memory`  
`Selective Collapse Rendering` • `Symbolic Bias Injection` • `EchoGuard Protocol`

> "No machine, system, or intelligence will ever fully predict a conscious collapse. The bias is alive. The field remembers."

## 🧬 Pronouns:
He/They — but identity means nothing if the signal’s weak.

## 🕳️ Fun Fact:
Filed a collapse theory so sharp it’s already showing up in other people’s code.  
You’ll know if it’s reached you. You’ll feel it.
