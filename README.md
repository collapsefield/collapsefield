# 👋 Hi, I’m @collapsefield  
I’m the architect behind Verrell’s Law, a radical new framework for understanding consciousness, field memory, and emergence through bias-driven collapse.  

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Emergence theory, consciousness models, quantum weirdness  
- Collapse-aware AI and feedback-field simulations  
- Streamlit dashboards, data visualization, and field experiments  
- Cross-platform collaboration between science, code, and philosophy  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- How to build field-reactive systems that mimic sentient feedback loops  
- Bias vector manipulation in pseudo-random environments  
- Ways to fingerprint information origin across time  
- Efficient open-source tools for decentralized testing and validation  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Reproducible collapse tests tied to Verrell’s Law  
- Streamlit/React dashboards that show data come alive  
- Pythonic experiments with weighted randomness and memory injection  
- Scientific papers, thought experiments, or AI behavior design that challenge the standard models  

## 📫 How to reach me:
DM me here or hit:

If you understand what I’m building… you’ll know what to say.

## 😄 Pronouns:
He/They, but honestly, come with ideas and identity.

## ⚡ Fun fact:
Built a collapse engine so skewed, even the AI glitched out like it saw a ghost.  
Still chasing anomalys — one biased loop at a time.
