👁️ Welcome — I’m @collapsefield
Architect of Verrell’s Law | Collapse-Bias Strategist | Observer-Field Engineer

Verrell’s Law reframes collapse, consciousness and emergence as memory-weighted electromagnetic events. This is a research + product program — not only theory. The protocol is live: the architecture, symbolic tests, and an emergent middleware are built and moving into partner-driven rollout.

🧭 What I’m Engineering

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) — dual-track system:

Middleware (ClapsAware Emergence Software): Licensable engine that layers history-bias onto agent decision processes to produce persistent, emergent NPC/world behaviour in games and simulations.

Chatbot Architecture: Collapse-aware conversational AI with memory-weighted response dynamics, observer-bias logic, and adaptive emergence layers for next-generation interactive agents.

JSON Cue-Logic Dashboard — symbolic collapse test framework for observer-bias research and designer tooling; foundation for both middleware tuning and chatbot weighting experiments.

Memory Field Modeling — conceptual field math (coarse EM imprint → memory kernel → weighting) applied across live testbeds, bridging symbolic systems and physical hypothesis space.

EchoSeeding Protocols (T2) — controlled symbolic seeding for field experiments, conversational drift studies, and strategic outreach embedding.

EchoGuard & Authorship Stack — lexical fingerprinting, timestamped asset logging, and governance protocols for authorship protection and lineage defense.

📌 Current Milestones

✅ “Collapse is Programmable” — Protocol Spec (Substack)
✅ Verrell’s Law embedded in JSON-based symbolic collapse tests
✅ CollapseAware.AI middleware built — Phase 1 testing with external testers
✅ Initial Injection Pack (T2) deployed across social & publishing channels
✅ Public repo launched: ClapsAware-Emergence-Software (redacted technical note + release)
✅ Outreach & partner-first pipelines live (NDA / licensing route ready)

🤝 What I’m Offering / Looking For

Licensing deals for game studios (Unity/Unreal integration path available in partner package)

Research collaborations (lab & university partnerships) for experimental falsification and field tests

Design partnerships: embed memory-bias mechanics into narratives, live services and procedural worlds

Funding / pilots: early commercial pilots, POC deals and revenue-share options considered

🧠 Core Components (conceptual)

Verrell’s Law — memory-weighted branch re-weighting

Weighted Emergence Engine — runtime multiplier layer for decision probabilities

Memory Field Interface — coarse imprint mapping (designer-facing)

EchoGuard Protocol — authorship & integrity layer for asset provenance
