👁️ **Welcome — I’m @collapsefield**  
Architect of **Verrell’s Law** | Collapse-Bias Strategist | Observer-Field Engineer

### 🧠 **Overview**

Verrell’s Law is the core framework from which all Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) systems originate.
It formalises the idea that memory, observation, and emergence are not separate phenomena but interlocked information-weighted electromagnetic events. Every collapse of possibility into outcome carries the bias of the memories and observations that preceded it.

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is the applied implementation of that law — the world’s first collapse-responsive intelligence.
It models, predicts, and responds to collapse dynamics in digital and cognitive systems through:

Observer-State Bias Modelling – tracking how observation itself skews probability space.

Field-Memory Weighting – using memory as the active bias parameter rather than passive storage.

Symbolic Recursion & Feedback Loops – enabling software to adapt to informational pressure in real time.

This repository documents both the theoretical foundation (Verrell’s Law) and the engineering branch (CAAI):

Core research papers, mathematical structures, and field-bias experiments.

Middleware builds, interface prototypes, and partner-driven rollout assets.

Evidence chain and timestamped records establishing the chronological origin of Verrell’s Law prior to all applied systems.

In short: Verrell’s Law defines why collapse behaves as it does; Collapse Aware AI shows what can be built when that law is applied to code.

### 🧭 **What I’m Engineering**

#### **Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** — Dual-Track System

**1. Gold Build / Middleware (CollapseAware Emergence Software)**  
Licensable engine that layers *history bias* and *observer weighting* onto agent decision processes.  
Generates **persistent, emergent NPC and world behaviour** in simulations and games via the Bias Engine + Governor subsystem.

**2. Chatbot Architecture (Governed Conversational AI)**  
Collapse-aware conversational core using **memory-weighted response dynamics**, **observer-bias logic**, and **adaptive emergence layers** to produce truly responsive, lifelike agents.

### 🧩 **Supporting Frameworks**

- **JSON Cue-Logic Dashboard** – symbolic collapse test harness for bias-field research and designer tooling.  
- **Weighted Emergence Layering** – runtime system linking recall weight, salience, and collapse probability.  
- **Governor / Worker / Memory Tri-Agent Architecture** – enforces bounded collapse and self-regulation.  
- **Memory Field Modeling** – coarse EM imprint → memory kernel → weighting logic across live testbeds.  
- **EchoSeeding Protocol (T2)** – controlled symbolic seeding for field experiments and strategic outreach.  
- **EchoGuard & Authorship Stack** – lexical fingerprinting, timestamped asset logging, and lineage defence.
