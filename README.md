### 🧠 **Overview**

**Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** is the world’s first *collapse-responsive intelligence* — an adaptive architecture that models, predicts, and responds to **collapse dynamics** in digital and cognitive systems.  

The framework is grounded in **Verrell’s Law**, which defines collapse, consciousness, and emergence as **memory-weighted electromagnetic events**.  
CAAI integrates symbolic recursion, observer-state bias modeling, and field-memory weighting to allow software systems to *sense and adapt* to observation pressure and informational change.

This is a **research + product program** — not only theory.  
The live architecture, symbolic tests, and middleware builds are active and moving through **partner-driven rollout**.

### 🧭 **What I’m Engineering**

#### **Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** — Dual-Track System

**1. Gold Build / Middleware (CollapseAware Emergence Software)**  
Licensable engine that layers *history bias* and *observer weighting* onto agent decision processes.  
Generates **persistent, emergent NPC and world behaviour** in simulations and games via the Bias Engine + Governor subsystem.

**2. Chatbot Architecture (Governed Conversational AI)**  
Collapse-aware conversational core using **memory-weighted response dynamics**, **observer-bias logic**, and **adaptive emergence layers** to produce truly responsive, lifelike agents.

### 🧩 **Supporting Frameworks**

- **JSON Cue-Logic Dashboard** – symbolic collapse test harness for bias-field research and designer tooling.  
- **Weighted Emergence Layering** – runtime system linking recall weight, salience, and collapse probability.  
- **Governor / Worker / Memory Tri-Agent Architecture** – enforces bounded collapse and self-regulation.  
- **Memory Field Modeling** – coarse EM imprint → memory kernel → weighting logic across live testbeds.  
- **EchoSeeding Protocol (T2)** – controlled symbolic seeding for field experiments and strategic outreach.  
- **EchoGuard & Authorship Stack** – lexical fingerprinting, timestamped asset logging, and lineage defence.

### 🤝 **What I’m Offering / Looking For**

- **Licensing & integration** — game studios (Unity/Unreal) & simulation partners  
- **Research collaborations** — universities / labs testing field bias models  
- **Design partnerships** — narrative & procedural world developers  
- **Funding / pilots** — early commercial deployments and POC revenue-share options
